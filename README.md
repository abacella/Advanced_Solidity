1)AssociateProfitSplitter 

It is a contract to split a specific amount equaly between 3 Accounts
When you deploy the contract you have to: 
- Pick the three Accounts that will receive the funds and fill -one, -two and -three with its addresses.
- It is important to keep zero on the value in the first deployment
- Enter the account and the right network in the Metamask wallet
- Make sure you have funds
- Once deployed you will see two buttoms

1. deposit
2. balance

The First one is to transfer the money to the selected accounts
The second one is to check is there is any balance left. If everything went right the funds will be transferes

Everytime you hit the buttoms to build the contract and to deposit you will need to confirm the transaction in the Metamask wallet.
